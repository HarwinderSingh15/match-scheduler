Select specific days for match scheduling from a calendar, with an additional option to select all
days.
Define different time slots for each selected day. For instance, a match might be scheduled
between 3 PM - 5 PM on Monday and have a different time slot for Tuesday or any other day.
Users can add multiple slots, but there should be no overlapping time between them for the
same day.
View the existing match schedule if they have previously saved it.
Delete any scheduled match slot (confirmation required).
Edit an existing match slot.
Persist data for future app launches by storing all data in the local database. You can choose
from options like Realm, SQLite, AsyncStorage, or any other preferred solution.
